2: go to Payload/Brawl Stars.app/ in your file manager and start a new tab and go to this location in your terminal.

3: In your file manager, you will see ipPatcher.py, open it in any text editor and locate in the first line of the script the patched_ip variable with a string.

4: Change the string to be your ipv4 address of your device you execute the server from.

5: After the ip changed is saved, in your terminal with the client location, execute this following command : python ipPatcher.py

6: Save and compile back to ipa format.
